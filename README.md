I chose to begin with a small, fast proof-of-concept to see how the API works. Using Net Ninja [OpenAI Tutorial (the Basics)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4ve8Kjw9ZY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ipdXMDVcGimIVMG_Z6-Vsu&index=1), which is a great introductory OpenAI turotial. The vidoes are concise, clear and perfect for getting started.
